<h2 align="center"><em style="color: magenta;">Disclaimer</em></h2>

- The background image is not owned by me — it was only edited with AI to match my vibe.  
- The colors and the overall magical design are my own implementation, though AI helped improve the CSS.  
- All the code is mine. I know there are some minor things that could be improved, but I need more knowledge to refine them.  
- I hope anyone who explores my Magic Library has as much fun as I had while creating it!  

Creating this “kinda working” web app was a whole new experience for me. I gained new knowledge, saw what was missing, and managed to improve it along the way. There were a lot of bugs, but each one taught me something new.
