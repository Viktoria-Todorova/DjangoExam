        <h2>The Librarian Who Remembered Every Story</h2>

        <p>
            No one knows when the Secret Library first appeared.
            One morning, between two ordinary buildings, a wooden door simply existed —
            warm to the touch even in winter.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most people never noticed it. Their eyes slipped past it, their thoughts ignored it.
            But a few stopped. The chosen ones.
        </p>

        <p>
            Inside were shelves stretching beyond sight, ladders climbing into mist,
            and knowledge too powerful to be kept in only one form.
        </p>

        <p class="whisper">
            Choose your path wisely…
        </p>
